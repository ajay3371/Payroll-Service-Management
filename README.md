## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajay3371/Payroll-Service-Management.git
   cd Payroll-Service-Management
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   For **Windows**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   For **MacOS/Linux**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the database:**
   - Update the database configuration in `settings.py` file. For PostgreSQL, modify the `DATABASES` section:
   
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'payroll_db',
           'USER': 'your_postgresql_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_postgresql_password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '5432',
       }
   }
   ```

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create the database if it doesn't already exist.

5. **Run database migrations:**
   Migrate the database to apply the necessary changes:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser (optional):**
   To access the Django admin panel and manage data:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password for the superuser.

7. **Start the development server:**
   To run the project locally, start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the API documentation**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/` to access the interactive Swagger UI where you can explore and test the API endpoints.
